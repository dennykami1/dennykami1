# Welcome to My GitHub

Hello! I'm Kami Denny, and this is my GitHub profile where I share my work and projects, with a focus on **GIS**, **geoprocessing tools**, and **data analytics**.

## GIS Experience and Geoprocessing Tools with Python
I have extensive experience in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), particularly in building custom geoprocessing tools using Python. My projects focus on automating spatial data workflows, performing spatial analysis, and transforming geospatial datasets. Highlights of my work include:

- **Custom Geoprocessing Tools:** Developed tools for automating GIS workflows using Python.
- **Python for GIS:** Skilled in libraries such as ArcPy, GeoPandas, and Shapely for geospatial data manipulation and analysis.

## Pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics
I'm currently pursuing a **Master's in Data Analytics**. A key course I am currently taking is **Continuous Intelligence and Interactive Analytics**, which focuses on:

- **Continuous Intelligence:** Leveraging real-time data processing to drive insights and decisions from streaming data.
- **Interactive Analytics:** Creating user-friendly dashboards and visualizations that allow dynamic interaction with datasets, improving data exploration and decision-making.
